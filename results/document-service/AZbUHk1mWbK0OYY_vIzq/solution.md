Issue Type: CODE_SMELL
Severity: MINOR
Message: Add logic to this catch clause or eliminate it and rethrow the exception automatically.

This Sonar issue is a code smell that indicates the presence of a catch clause with no logic inside it, which can lead to confusion and difficulty in understanding the code's behavior. It is considered a minor issue because it does not cause any functional errors or bugs, but it does make the code less maintainable and harder to understand.

To fix this issue, you have two options:

1. Add logic to the catch clause: If there is a specific reason for catching the exception (e.g., to handle a known error scenario), you should add some logic inside the catch clause to handle the exception in a meaningful way. This could involve logging the exception, sending a notification to the developer or team responsible for the code, or performing any other necessary actions to address the issue.
2. Eliminate the catch clause and rethrow the exception automatically: If there is no specific reason for catching the exception, you can eliminate the catch clause altogether and let the exception bubble up to the calling method. This will allow the exception to be handled by the parent method or the framework, which can provide more context and meaningful error handling.

Here's an example of how to fix this issue:
```
try {
    // Some code that throws an exception
} catch (e) {
    console.log(e); // Log the exception
    throw e; // Rethrow the exception automatically
}
```
In this example, we have added a `console.log()` statement to log the exception before rethrowing it automatically. This allows us to handle the exception in a meaningful way while still allowing the code to continue executing without any issues.

Best practices to prevent similar issues:

1. Catch only what you can handle: When catching exceptions, make sure that you are only handling the types of exceptions that you can actually handle. If you are catching a generic `Exception` or `Throwable`, it's likely that you will be swallowing other types of exceptions as well, which could cause issues further down the line.
2. Use meaningful variable names: When catching an exception, use a meaningful variable name to indicate what type of exception is being caught. This can help other developers understand what the code is trying to do and why it's catching that particular exception.
3. Avoid using empty catch clauses: As mentioned earlier, avoid using empty catch clauses altogether. If you are not going to handle an exception in any meaningful way, let it bubble up to a higher level or rethrow it automatically.
4. Test your code thoroughly: Finally, make sure that you are testing your code thoroughly to ensure that it is behaving as expected and that there are no unintended side effects from catching exceptions.
